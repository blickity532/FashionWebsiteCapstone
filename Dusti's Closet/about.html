                Welcome to Dusti's Closet â€“ your go-to women's fashion store! Born from the challenges of the COVID-19 era, Dusti's Closet started as a reselling venture on eBay and Poshmark. Dusti's passion for fashion turned these platforms into the canvas for her dream, curating a unique collection during lockdown. Now, after five years, Dusti's Closet has grown into its own online store, marking a transition from reselling to a fully-fledged brand. Explore our curated collection, reflecting Dusti's journey from reselling roots to an independent online haven. Join us in celebrating the transformative power of a dream amidst adversity.
